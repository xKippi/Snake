1. Hey there and have fun with my game.
2. You can ajust almost all settings in the config file, which is located at the startup path of the program.
3. If the program can't set the window size try a smaller Fontsize.
4. If you find a bug/issue please report it.
5. If you have any complaints or suggestions please also report them to the issues board.

6. Have fun and feel free to recode, redistribute, ... it :)
