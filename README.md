Hey there and have fun with my game.  
If you find a bug/issue please report it [here](http://github.com/xKippi/Snake/issues/).  
If you have any complaints or suggestions please also report them [here](http://github.com/xKippi/Snake/issues/).  

Have fun and feel free to recode, redistribute, ... it :)  
  
**CONTROLS:**  
Player 1: WASD to move  
Player 2: Arrow Keys to move  
Note: Player 1 and Player 2 keys can be configured in the config file  
Pause: [ESC] or [P]  

**HELP:**  
 \- You can ajust almost all settings in the snake.conf file, which is located at the startup path of the program.  
 \- If the program can't set the window size try a smaller Fontsize.
