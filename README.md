Hey there and have fun with my game.
If you find a bug/issue please report it [here](http://github.com/xKippi/Snake/issues/).
If you have any complaints or suggestions please also report them to the issues board.

Have fun and feel free to recode, redistribute, ... it :)


**CONTROLS:**
Player 1: WASD to move
Player 2: Arrow Keys to move
Pause: [ESC] or [P]

**HELP:**
 - You can ajust almost all settings in the snake.conf file, which is located at the startup path of the program.
 - If the program can't set the window size try a smaller Fontsize.
